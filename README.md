**Fract-ol** is a fractal explorer built with precision and a love for mathematical beauty. Developed as part of the 42 curriculum, this project generates famous fractals like the Mandelbrot set and Julia sets in real time, showcasing the intricate patterns and infinite complexity of these mathematical phenomena.

Dive into the stunning visual representations of famous fractals, all while pushing your understanding of complex numbers and recursion to the next level. Whether you're here to fine-tune your skills in graphical programming or just want to create art out of math, Fract-ol has got you covered.

## Features ðŸŒŸ
- **Multiple Fractals**: From the iconic Mandelbrot to the ever-dynamic Julia sets.
- **Zoom & Explore**: Interactive zoom functionality lets you dive into the infinite complexity of fractals.
- **Real-time Rendering**: Experience smooth and responsive visuals, thanks to optimized algorithms.
- **Customizable Colors**: Make the fractals pop with your own color schemes.
- **Simple Controls**: Intuitive keyboard and mouse controls for easy navigation through fractal spaces.
